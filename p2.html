                    <p>Biomimicry is the method of imitating aspects of the biological world in technology 
                        and design to solve human problems. One area where biomimicry can be found is in city 
                        development. In fact, there are numerous instances where biomimicry has been used to 
                        further transportation and architecture. Biomimicry in the case of transportation allows 
                        people aerodynamic traversal across vast distances. Take for instance how in Japan, 
                        bullet trains have been partly designed off of the beak of kingfisher birds. To further explain, 
                        prior to the introduction of kingfisher biology in locomotion, Japanese bullet 
                        trains faced a problem involving their nose, which would compress air into a 
                        soundwave, eventually expanding into a sonic boom out the end of the tunnel, 
                        disturbing nearby people, passengers, and wildlife, as well slowing down the trains, 
                        due to the compressed air building a barrier of sorts in front the train as it moved. 
                        However, later on, the Japanese Railway Company’s chief engineer took notice of 
                        kingfisher birds and their long and narrow beaks. Such beaks allow these birds the 
                        advantage of having water pass around their beak than build in front of it. 
                        Essentially, with their beaks, kingfisher birds could dive into the water with little 
                        splash. Thus, bullet trains in Japan started to have their noses more long and narrowed, 
                        like that of a kingfisher’s beak, as such a shape would allow air to flow over the trains 
                        and their nose rather than become compressed, making the bullet trains less loud and faster.

                    <p>Biomimicry has also fostered the advancement in architecture as previously mentioned. 
                        This is found in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, where a building called the Eastgate 
                        Centre stands, which like many other buildings in the city, could get really hot at times. 
                        Not to mention, air conditioning could be costly as well. This led to termite mounds being 
                        looked at by Zimbabwean architect Mike Pearce as a model for the building, as termite mounds 
                        had a form of makeshift air conditioning, allowing for cool air to remain at the bottom, while 
                        the warm air would be circulated at the top through tiny holes. Likewise, when Eastgate Centre 
                        incorporated Pearce’s ideas of imitating the design of a termite mound, the building ended up 
                        with fans at the bottom of each of its towers, pushing cool air from the bottom upward through 
                        ducts, where warm air is carried out through chimneys. The inspiration from termite mounds 
                        have actually worked out in the Eastgate centre’s favor, allowing it to use 10% less energy 
                        than other buildings its size, and allowing it to save almost 3.5 million dollars on air conditioning.
