                    <p>By definition, biomimicry is a practice learned from and mimics the strategies found in nature 
                        to solve human design challenges. It has many different implications in human society including 
                        both commercial and military implications. In fact, there are numerous military implications of 
                        biomimicry that bring success to a country’s technology development and military tactics.

                    </div>
                    <p>First, humans have learned a lot about aerodynamics and hydromechanics from mother nature, 
                        and we apply them to battleships and fighter jets. For example, the B-2 bomber, designed 
                        and introduced in 1989 by American military engineers, mimics the shape of falcons in order 
                        to produce the best aerodynamic performance. During the designing process, one of the problems 
                        that engineers faced was designing an aircraft that’s large enough to carry a large number of 
                        weapons, while also being fuel-efficient. Fuel-efficiency is very important in aircraft design, 
                        especially for fighter jets that are going to execute intercontinental missions. Finally, 
                        engineers found the perfect shape in the form of a peregrine falcon. As a predator, the bird 
                        needs to frequently dive into the ocean from high above to catch fish. An adult peregrine 
                        falcon can reach a maximum of 390 km/h at the moment it reaches the ocean surface. Its special 
                        aerodynamic shape provides the falcon with the ability to reach such speed and save energy for 
                        the next dive. US military engineers adapted such shape to the design of the B-2 bomber, and 
                        finally made the B-2 the most advanced and long-range bomber in the world.

                    <div class="global-headline">
                        <h1 class="headline headline-dark">OFFSET</h1>

                    </div>
                    <p>Secondly, biomimicry also provided inspirations in military tactics that lead to success 
                        in wars and conflicts. The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency has developed 
                        a new tactic to allow small infantry robotic forces to execute complex missions in war 
                        zones, which is called the OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET) program. This tactic 
                        is mimicking a common behavior in both human and animal societies. Certain species of 
                        fish and birds will usually hunt and travel together to avoid predators and other dangers. 
                        When the population density reaches a certain level, individual thought will be replaced 
                        by collective consciousness and the whole population will work together to achieve a certain 
                        goal. For example, certain species of fish will form a spherical shape when the whole population 
                        is under attack by predators. In the OFFSET program, more than 250 small weaponized drones were 
                        programmed with the swarming behavior and they will collaborate together to complete missions. 
                        During the development process of the swarm model, developers tested the swarming behavior of 
                        robots using technologies such as virtual reality. During the swarm tactics game, players would 
                        use the interface to rapidly explore, evolve, evaluate swarm tactics to see which would work the 
                        best. Then, the optimal swarm tactic will be used in real-life missions and combat.
